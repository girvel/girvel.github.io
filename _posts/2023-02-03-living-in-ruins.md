# Living in Ruins

Creative people often like ruins, and it's not obvious why they do. They drink in bars with cracked brick walls, play Dishonored, Metro and Stalker and overall enjoy the genres that end with -punk. Why?


My guess is that love for the ruins correlates with nonconformism. Some people don't agree with the society on all the points and feel pressure from it while they are in a very nice, civilized places. So in their resting time they choose to avoid epicenters of humanity, preferring some abandoned-looking locations where they can feel safe. 

But it's just a guess.
