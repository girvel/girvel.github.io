# Philidor for black is actually interesting

Philidor defense is traditionally considered to be a bad opening. "From the point of view of an engine it can be playable, but for a real human player it's too passive, you shouldn't play it". Moreover, when I've tried researching it, I have found much more videos with ways how to play against it than the tutorials for black itself. 

Anyway, I've played it quite a bit and found it to be quite a nice opening. It is more solid than passive, black has good control of the center, a couple of interesting long-term plans and a clear setup. It has some similarities with Pirc and Italian, but it's actually much more comfortable to play.

Italian is basically exactly the same opening, but the dark square bishop is outside the pawn chain. It seems like an advantage, but in reality the bishop can easily be harassed with pawns or exchanged for white's bishop.

In Philidor bishop seems trapped, but it easily comes out to the long diagonal via f6 or to exactly the same c5, but later, when the timing is better.

Pirc is a very nice opening if white closes down the center and allows the flank pawn storm with f5; if this variation was forced, I would play it all the time, even with white. But it is not. White can easily exchange e pawns and transition to a dry queenless middlegame, where black has a very stupid dark square bishop staring at its own knight and pawn.

Philidor's exchange variations are much more comfortable. You can easily avoid exchange of queens and your bishop is quite happy.

Also, Pirc has a drawback of weakening the dark squares around black king, which is easily exploited in various attacks with opposite side castling. For example, the plan for white of going f3, exchanging dark square bishops and then pawn storming the black king is practically unstoppable on amateur level.

Philidor has its share of opposite side castling and attacking, but it creates much fewer weaknesses on the kingside.

Overall, I just had fun playing Philidor a last couple of days and also wanted to test embedding lichess analysis into my blog posts. Also, have a look at my latest casual game online, it is nice.
