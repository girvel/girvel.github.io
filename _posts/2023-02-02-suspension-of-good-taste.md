Hello there!

Good taste is a quite tricky thing. Having it almost equals to intelligence in most areas of your life: you can write better code, you can choose better things, and you can escape some bad encounters with strange people. It is a very good trait, except that it can hold you back greatly.

For example, if I wanted to create my own site for my own fun (which I just did), I would probably get an AWS server or build my own, set up Nginx, used Python+Flask to create a backend or even dared to write it in Rust and something like Typescript + React for frontend; all that would take a lot of time and effort and I would probably get stuck on some stage and move on to another pet project. But if I'd finished, it would be a very shitty web page with a very good pieces of code somewhere deep inside, which nobody will ever see and it all would go to waste.

But, as you can see, I have a website. So, this post is a praise to my laziness, the suspension of my taste and to the [very good tutorial for the people who barely even know how to code but still want to have a Github Pages website](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). Sometimes it's good to just be practical.
